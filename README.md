# Coder Roadmap

A webpage that guides you from a complete beginner to a professional coder with a step-by-step roadmap. Learn coding basics, master data structures, build projects, contribute to open source, land internships, and explore advanced tech topics—all in one place!

## 🚀 What Is This Project?

This is a single-page website designed to help anyone new to coding become a pro. Whether you’re starting from zero or aiming for a tech job, the roadmap covers every stage of your journey:
- **Beginner**: Learn what coding is and start with easy languages.
- **Intermediate**: Tackle data structures and algorithms (DSA) and competitive programming.
- **Practical**: Build real projects and share them on GitHub.
- **Community**: Join open source and hackathons.
- **Career**: Prepare for internships and placements.
- **Growth**: Explore advanced topics and give back to the community.

The webpage is mobile-friendly, has a light/dark mode toggle, and includes links to free resources, making it a go-to guide you can bookmark and follow at your own pace.
